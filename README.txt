Homey App for the Tuya cloud. This app is currently in beta status.

This app connects with a Tuya API to control your devices. This app needs an internet connection to function, 
if there is no internet then you can only control your devices with the mobile app. 
You have to pair your devices first with the mobile app. At the moment only the Tuya app and the Smart Life app are supported.
